Python program to calculate Sun/Moon rise/set times and azimuths from latitude/longitude, or worldwide name/address data.
Calculated times are output in UTC and/or in local time (with correct day light saving time offset).

```ma.py``` Mondaufgang (ma)


### To do

- [ ] add calculation of Lunar exclipses to ma.py


### Outdated 

Outdated is the older PHP program su.php:

PHP program to calculate Sun/Moon rise/set times and azimuths, and also Lunar eclipses from latitude/longitude, or worldwide name/address data.
Calculated times are output in UTC and/or in local time (with correct day light saving time offset).

Defunct: local time determination via an external web service api.teleport.org, as this web service is no longer working.
